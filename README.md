# Web Application Framework - NodeJS
This is a simple web application framework built with NodeJS and ExpressJS designed with modern design patterns in mind, pushing JSON responses out for a front end framework like Angular, React or Vue to consume. It is intended to be a simple starting point that you can quickly build on top of without being overly opinionated or bulky.

## Endpoints
Several sample endpoints are included. To create or modify an endpoint you will need to define a route for it in routes.js, create a corresponding class module in the src/ directory and include it in routes.js in the Load Modules section. Use one of the sample modules for reference if needed.
